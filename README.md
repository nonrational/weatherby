# Weatherby

Weatherby, what's the weather like?

# Tasks
- [x] set up a node environment
- [x] parse CSV arguments of locations
- [x] normalize those locations (or find an api that can tolerate any location-like string)
- [x] given a location-like string, ask what the weather is
- [x] for each location, print the normalized version and the current weather
- [x] if the API returns an error (as in no normalized location can be found), print that at the end.
- [ ] npm module for s's & g's?
